I developed flappy bird app using Unity and C#. I also implemented a genetic algoritm to make the bird play the game on its own. 

Source codes of the program are been: flappyBird -> Assets -> Scripts

Executable file of the program : Build -> flappyBird.exe 

Detailed explanation of the game : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMJaD1vNnJs
